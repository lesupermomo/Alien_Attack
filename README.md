# Alien_Attack

Alien Attack is a first-person shooter (FPS) game developed as my first project using Unity. In this immersive experience, players can navigate through a dynamic environment, aiming to shoot down incoming threats.The game features player movement and an RTS-style camera that offers a unique perspective on the action. This project marks the beginning of my game development journey, combining core FPS mechanics with strategic camera controls.
